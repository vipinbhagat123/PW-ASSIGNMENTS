        "Median: The median is the middle value of a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order.

        "Variance: Variance measures the average squared deviation of each value from the mean. It provides an indication of the overall variability of the dataset. A higher variance indicates a wider spread of values, while a lower variance indicates a more concentrated dataset.\n",
